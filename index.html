  <p>James was born in Northridge California, but was soon transplanted by his parents, to grow up in the Northern Californian Wine Country.
    Music has always been a big part of his life, and all along the way, James has fulfilled his love for singing through barbershop
    and vocal jazz – something that started when his father taught him to harmonize at age three. It was a trip to Disneyland
    that finally propelled him from self-study to eventually graduate Summa Cum Laude with his Bachelor of Music degree in Film
    Scoring and Electronic Production & Design from Berklee College of Music in Boston.</p>

  <p>He has sung competitively in the barbershop world since high school, and continues his “informal” education in the style as an active vocal arranger, coach, and
    performer. These days, you can find James engineering at 18 Source Productions in Citrus Heights, an incredible recording studio that he
    helped his friend Mark Kellogg build from the ground up! You can also find him studying programming, graphic design, and dancing in his spare time.</p>
